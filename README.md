PHP-Login *** DEVELOPMENT VERSION ***
=========

A simple, secure login/user management system built on PHP, MySQL, jQuery and Bootstrap 3 as well as PHP-Mailer for user account verification and confirmation and several other open source libraries.

## Installation
### Clone the Repository (dev branch) into your webserver root
    $ git clone -b dev https://github.com/fethica/PHP-Login.git

### Run through web-based installer (located in /install folder of the application)
    Go to http://www.yoursite.com/install/index.php

### Select installation option

### Enter all relevant information into the form, submit, and wait for install to complete.

    If any errors occur, you may need to do some manual work to get it up and running. This is still a development version, so your mileage may vary.

Once installation is complete, click the login link to sign in under your superadmin account and finish editing site configuration (most importantly, your SMTP server). Hover over the name of each setting to see a description.
